###  Docker 

### Overview

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

### Instructions

### Exercise 1: Getting started with Docker

1. On the LabVM provided to you, from the left click on **Visual Studio code**  and open it.

5. Now run the below command to get the docker version information.  This command will render all the version information of the docker installed in an easy to read layout.

   ```
     docker version
   ```

6. Type the following command to get system wide information regarding the Docker installation. Information displayed includes the kernel version, number of containers and images. As we have not yet created any containers or images you will receive the conainers and images count as zero.

   ```
     docker info
   ```
