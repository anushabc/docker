###  Docker 

### Overview

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

### Instructions

### Exercise 1: Getting started with Docker

1. On the LabVM provided to you, from the left click on **Visual Studio code**  and open it.

2. In the **Visual Studio code** notice docker has been already installed.

3. Now to run docker commands open Terminal by clicking on **Terminal (1)** and **New Terminal (2)**.

   ![](./images/dock3.png "SSMS Toolbar")

4. In the terminal type  ```docker``` and hit enter. This will list the available commands.

5. Now run the below command to get the docker version information.  This command will render all the version information of the docker installed in an easy to read layout.

   ```
     docker version
   ```
   ![](./images/dock5.png "SSMS Toolbar")

6. Type the following command to get system-wide information regarding the Docker installation.  The information displayed includes the kernel version, number of containers, and images. As we have not yet created any containers or images you will receive the container and images count as zero.

   ```
     docker info
   ```

### Exercise 2:  Working with Docker Containers

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.


1. In the terminal run the below command to list all of the containers. This command will list all the containers that are present in your docker.

   ```
   docker ps -a
   ```
   
   > **Note**: 
     - As we have not created any docker containers the command will return an empty list. 
     - ```docker ps``` command will list only running containers
   
2. Now to create a docker container run the below command. This command runs a container named test using the ubuntu:18.04 image. The -it instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the container’s stdin; creating an interactive bash shell in the container. 

   ```
   docker container run --name test -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash
   ```
   
   ![](./images/dock7.png "SSMS Toolbar")
  
3. Notice that you are logged in to the container.

4. Now, inside the container run the following command to verify the operating system you are working on.

   ```
   cat /etc/*release*
   ```
   
   ![](./images/dock9.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
5. Exit the container by running the below command.

   ```
   exit
   ```
   
5. Enter the below command to show the list of running containers and observe your container is not listed this is because the container is in the stopped state.

   ```
   docker ps 
   ```

   ![](./images/dock10.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
6. Start your container by running the below command:

   ```
   docker container start test
   ```
   
   ![](./images/dock11.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
7. In the terminal run ```docker ps``` and verify your container status is up.

   ![](./images/dock12.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
8. Rename your container from test to prod by running the below command:

   ```
   docker container rename test prod
   ```
   
9. Run the docker list command and observe your container is renamed to prod.

   ![](./images/dock13.png "SSMS Toolbar")

10. Now run the below command to get the process details of the container.

    ```
    docker top prod
    ```
    ![](./images/dock14.png "SSMS Toolbar")
    
11. Run the below commands to create a bash session into the container and create files in the container.

    ```
    docker exec -it prod bash 
    ```
    
12. Now inside the container create a file named temp1 by running the below command:

     ```
     touch temp1
     ```
     
13. Verify that you are can to list your newly created file and exit from the container:

    ```
    ls -l
    ```
    
    ```
    exit
    ```   
    ![](./images/dock15.png "SSMS Toolbar")
    
14. Now copy the  temp file which you create inside the container to  the host machine by running the below command

    ```
    docker cp prod:/temp1  c:\users\demouser
    ```
15. In your terminal run the list command and verify the file has been copied from your container to the host machine.

    ```
    ls
    ```

### Exercise 3: Working with Docker images

A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.

A Docker image contains application code, libraries, tools, dependencies and other files needed to make an application run. When a user runs an image, it can become one or many instances of a container.

1. In your terminal run the below command to list all the images that are present in your system. Notice your ubuntu image is listed.

   ```
   docker image ls
   ```
