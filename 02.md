###  Docker 

### Overview

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

### Instructions

### Exercise 1: Getting started with Docker

1. On the LabVM provided to you, from the left click on **Visual Studio code**  and open it.

2. In the **Visual Studio code** notice docker has been already installed.

3. Now to run docker commands open Terminal by clicking on **Terminal (1)** and **New Terminal (2)**.

4. In the terminal type  ```docker``` and hit enter. This will list the available commands.

5. Now run the below command to get the docker version information.  This command will render all the version information of the docker installed in an easy to read layout.

   ```
     docker version
   ```

6. Type the following command to get system wide information regarding the Docker installation. Information displayed includes the kernel version, number of containers and images. As we have not yet created any containers or images you will receive the conainers and images count as zero.

   ```
     docker info
   ```

### Exercise 2:  Working with Docker conatiners

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.


1. In the terminal run the below command to list all of the containers. This command will list all the containers that are present in your docker.

   ```
   docker ps -a
   ```
   
   > **Note**: 
     - As we have not created any docker containers the command will return an empty list. 
     - ```docker ps``` command will list only running containers
   
2. Now to create a docker container run the below command. This command runs a container named test using the ubuntu:18.04 image. The -it instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the container’s stdin; creating an interactive bash shell in the container. 

   ```
   docker container run --name test -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash
   ```
  
3. Notice that you are logged in to the container. 


4. Now, inside the container run the following command to verify the operating system your working on.

   ```
   cat /etc/*release*
   ```
   
5. Exit the conatiner by running the below command.

   ```
   exit
   ```
   
5. Enter the below command to show list of containers. You will observe that the your container is in the list and is in exited state.

   ```
   docker container ps -a
   ```

6. Start your conatiner
   ```
   docker container start Container ID
   ```
   
5. Enter the below command to connect to your newly created container:

   ```
