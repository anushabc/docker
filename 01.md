###  Docker 

### Overview

Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that promotes and evolves this technology, working in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors, including Microsoft.

Docker provides a way to run applications securely isolated in a container, packaged with all its dependencies and libraries.


### Instructions

#### Task 1: Installing Docker


1.  Before installing **Docker Engine**, you need to set up the Docker repository and ensure latest packages are installed on the system. 
    Run the below command to update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS.

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    ```
    sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
    ```
   
2. Now add Docker’s official GPG key by running below command. This key is required to ensure that all data is encrypted when downloading the necessary packages for Docker.

    ```
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

3. Next you will need to add the relevant site to the docker.list for the apt package manager, so that it will be able to detect the Docker packages from the Docker site and download them accordingly.

    ```
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```
    
4. Now update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
   
5. Install the Docker Engine by running below command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce
   ```
   

### Task 2: Working with Docker conatiners

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.


1. In your ubuntu machine run the below command to list all of the containers.

   ```
   docker container ls
   ```
   
   > **Note**: As we have not created any docker containers the command will return an empty list
   
2. Now to create a docker container run the below command. This command creates a new docker container named test from ubuntu image.

  ```
  docker container run --name test  ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
  ```
  
3. Enter the command to show running containers. You will observe that the ubuntu container is in the list. 

   Make note of your Container ID

   ```
   docker container ls -a
   ```

4. Now to start the newly created container run the below command. Replace Container ID with the value you copied in above step.

   ```
   docker container start Container ID
   ```
   
5. Enter the below command to connect to your newly created container:

   ```
