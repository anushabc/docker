###  Docker 

### Overview

Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that promotes and evolves this technology, working in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors, including Microsoft.

Docker provides a way to run applications securely isolated in a container, packaged with all its dependencies and libraries.


### Instructions

#### Task 1: Installing Docker


1.  Before installing Docker engine, we need to set up the Docker repository and ensure latest packages are installed on the system. Run the below command to update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS.

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    ```
    sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
    ```
   
2. Now add Docker’s official GPG key by running below command. This key is required to ensure that all data is encrypted when downloading the necessary packages for Docker.

    ```
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

3. Next, depending on the version of Ubuntu you have, you will need to add the relevant site to the docker.list for the apt package manager, so that it will be able to detect the Docker packages from the Docker site and download them accordingly.

    ```
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```
